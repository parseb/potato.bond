# Let Thee With Potato Bond Be

## Farmer
First there was the farmer. Without the farmer there was no potato. Praised be.

A farmer is an EOA that self-identifies as such through the use of an ERC721 farmer token. A farmer token is a representation of "the farm". A new farmer can be freely minted only with the approval of another farmer. <br>

Farmer -> Farmer  (1-1)

## Area
The farmer inhabited the lands. And the multitude of lands constituted an Area. Be them geographical or economical, physical or imaginary, areas are to be defined the whims of the farmer. A farmer can belong to many areas. (Circles of compassion an identity or marketable verticals.)

An area is intended to be a govenrable collaborative surface defined particularly along external needs and identities. The global registry of Areas extends along the lines of ERC1155. 

The following global rules apply: 
- 1(*10**16) fungible token is minted for both farmer and consummer on a finalized Farmer-Basket-Consumer exchage.
- Farmer access to an area is (1-1) peer permissioned
- An Area has an owner. The owner governs over the terms of value transfer. This makes an area self-determination capable. (Potantial Features: resale tax, threasury, infrastructure, recovery, incentives etc.)

## Basket
Potato is good. A basket of potatoes is better and as such is the core unit of exchange and the fixed point around which the farmer-area-consumer complex revolves. Observes ERC721 conduct.


## Consummer
A consumer is what you don't wish your kid to be though you know that they will inevitably be so. Consummers consume. Afterall, the consumer role is just an abstract role and not a personality crafting activity... right? Being a role, in the same way Farmer is, it follows ERC721 rules. A consummer belongs to an area. Gaining and maintaining the role of consummer in an area is subject to area rules. A customer belongs to only one area.
