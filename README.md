## Farmer
First there was the farmer. No potato without farmer. Praised be. 
<br><br>
A farmer is a number that self-advertises to the rest of the world as such through the use of an ERC721 farmer token. A farmer token is a representation of "the farm". A new farmer can be freely minted. Multiple farmers can collaborate within the same Area. A farmer can join an area only if invited by a farmer that is already a member of an Area. <br>

(Area genesis) <-> Farmer(0) -> Farmer(1) -> Farmer(x) (1-to-1=inviter-to-invited relationship)

## Area 

The farmer inhabited the lands. And the multitude of lands constituted an Area. Be them geographical or economical, physical or imaginary, areas are to be bounded only by the imaginary of the farmer. A farmer can belong to many areas. (Circles of compassion, identity or marketable verticals.)

An area is intended to be a govenrable collaborative surface defined particularly along external needs and identities. The global registry of Areas extends along the lines of ERC1155. 

The following global rules apply: 
- 1 (**18) area specific fungible token is minted for both farmer and consummer on a finalized Farmer-Basket-Consumer exchage.
- Farmer access to an area is (1-1) peer permissioned
- An Area has an owner. (EOA/Multisig/0) The owner governs over the terms of value transfer. This makes an area self-determination capable. (Potantial Features: resale tax, threasury, infrastructure, social recovery, incentives etc.)

## Basket <br>
Potato is good. A basket of potatoes is better and as such is the core unit of exchange and the fixed point around which the farmer-area-consumer complex revolves. Observes ERC721A conduct.

## Consumer <br>
 >`Consumo ergo sum,` <br>
 >`Consumers be consuming,`<br>

<br>
 Afterall, the consumer role is just an abstract role and not a personality crafting activity nor a way to fight the bad guys... right? Being a role, in the same way Farmer is, it follows ERC721 rules. A consummer is defined by the act of consumming from an area. Gaining and maintaining the role of consummer in an area is subject to area rules. A customer can consume from many areas. How one becomes a consummer in an area, and what being and doing so entitles is at the discretion of that particular area.

This is by no means aimed to be prescriptive but rather to provide some primordial structure for experimentation.

## Ideology

I know you think you're instrumentalizing that thing between your ears called brain to be an independent thinker, but are you, really? <br>

The CSA wikipedia page, has an 'ideology section' which I believe to significantly conductive of what ethereum people tend to point out to as being 'ethereum values'. That's it. That and of course the very noble endgame of humanity known as <i>fully automated luxury gay space communism.</i> <br>

Let me however indulge in spelling out some of the goodies of this "make the world a better place"-ism. The post-ideology <i>Ubermensch</i> would call these competitive advantages. <br>

- less consumption might be desieble, but since we do not want to alienate the snowflakes, we'll call it <b>more efficient consumption</b>. The fact that the spawning of goods, particularly those of universal human necessity can be locally incentivised and coordinated, affords more time for oil to stay in the ground and lorry drivers to seldomly afford a weekend with the grandchildren in the vegetable garden.

- money that grows on trees and makes sounds when the wind of change is blowing, is good money. As such, if a farmer's potato basket NFT redeamable in 2 years is higher than the price of a potato basket that is redeamable today, you can be sure that the ancestral wind of change is trying to say something. The potato yield curve is a potential indicator of food insecurity, in that area, or in the area between that area and the Equator. Or not, since potatoes fair rather well in sand.

- gives smaller production operations a chance to compete and integrate into the local context. Also makes experimentation (by assumed broad cost distribution) more likely. Imagine finding a way out of like industrial-packed-monoculture-profit-centered farming dude... pass that shit.
